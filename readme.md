#Big Picture#

* Server code is a branch of Paradise Netrek 3.1p0 (the current latest stable server release, and at current dev rates, likely it will stay 'current' forever)
* Client code is a branch of Paradise Netrek 3.3 (current latest stable client release, same deal)
* Main priority goal is client-code compatibility with the CS lab computers (Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS i686)
* Secondary goal, 64-bit safe code
* Tertiary goal, increasing maximum player-count on server?
