README for Paradise Netrek client 3.3p0

This is a stable release of the Paradise client.  This client was formerly
known as the "TedTurner" client, and it is a full-color version of the
older Paradise 2.x clients.  This client is required to play on Paradise
servers, but it can also be used to play on other Netrek servers such as
Bronco, Hockey, Chaos and INL.

For more information on Paradise, visit http://paradise.netrek.org/
For more information on Netrek, visit http://www.netrek.org/

This client is distributed in two forms: binary and source.  To prevent
clever players from modifying the source to cheat on the public servers, a
Netrek client uses RSA public key cryptography to allow only special
RSA-enabled ("blessed") clients to connect to and play on RSA-enabled
servers.  Some servers are RSA-disabled, so either blessed or unblessed
clients are allowed.

If you are interested in playing Paradise or Netrek, you need to download
the binary for your platform.  You do not need to download the source code
and compile it.

Paradise client RSA-enabled binaries and source code are available from:

	ftp://ftp.netrek.org/pub/netrek/clients/tedturner/
	ftp://ftp.netrek.org/pub/netrek/paradise/

The binaries are generally named in the following way:

	paradise-client-"version"."vendor_name"-"OS_name"-"OS-version"

For example, paradise client 3.3p0 for an SGI IRIX 6.5 workstation and
paradise client 3.3p0 for an Intel Linux system based on glibc2.1 would be:

	paradise-client-3.3p0.sgi-IRIX-6.5
	paradise-client-3.3p0.intel-Linux-glibc2.1

If a binary for your platform does not exist and you are interested in
helping with the port (i.e. you can port it yourself or can provide remote
access to the machine), please contact the Paradise client maintainer(s)
and/or the paradise work group.

If you find bugs or problems, please report them back to the maintainer.  
Suggestions and comments are also welcome.
