Things to do for the TedTurner client:

2000/03/15 (conversation with Rado):
Messaging - when invoked with the message command (cursor on local or map),
it stays in message-mode until one presses Enter or Esc, perhaps
controlled by an .xtrekrc option. (it irritated [Rado] more than once when
[he] typed something and came over the right border that it interpreted
[his] text as commands, almost always draining or killing [him].)
Suggestion for option-name: continuousMessage.

- Eric reported that the client bug that appears when flying near the right
edge is a Paradise-server specific pproblem.  It does not happen in non-
Paradise servers.

- From Jeffrey Watts:

I can't reproduce this bug under IRIX 6.5 and Solaris 2.5.1.  It looks like
a Linux specific bug, and I can't say whether it is TT related or a bug
in the kernel/glibc/X/etc. -Dave

I *have* seen this bug under Irix.  Somehow some pixmaps (FED SB, I think)
are being spewed all over beyond the rightmost-edge of the galaxy and
causing the client to crawl.

- Update on the bug reported by Nick:

- Solaris 2.5.1 binary exhibits the following problem.  Reproducible?

- Self-owned torps should be different color/size from friendly torps.

- Phaser colors don't match 2.4 client.

- Planets < 4 armies should not disappear off galactic.

- Some people have reported sluggishness with TT.  I don't notice this,
but maybe some feedback or testing might help.

- Documentation.

- Needed images (not complete):
galactic surface images (STND, THIN, etc)
galactic surface overlay images (STND, THIN, etc)
galactic resource images (Arable, Dilithium, etc)
galactic resource overlay images (Arable, Dilithium, etc)
local map surface overlay images
local resource overlay images
local age images (scout time)
