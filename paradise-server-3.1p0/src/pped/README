pped (version 1.1)

This is a relatively simple Paradise player database editor.  Although I
have given it a reasonable amount of testing, there probably still are
bugs.  So, please always keep backups of your .players file.

Usage: pped [file]
Where [file] is the pathname of the player database file to be edited.
If no file is specified, then it looks for a file called .players in
the current directory


**** Important notes ****

I don't have any instructions yet, my apologies for this.  You can get
a list of available commands by entering '?' at a prompt.

When you are in the edit screen, where the prompt looks like
"Edit: Command (? for help) -->", you need to specify Save to record
whatever changes you've made.  This only changes the database in
memory, it won't affect any files.

When you specify Save in the Index screen, however, you will be prompted
for a filename, and then the entire database is written into that file.
This is the only place where a file can be changed by this program.

pped reads the entire db into memory, so when you edit individual entries,
nothing will actually be changed in the .players file until you save
the whole thing out.  The main disadvantage to this is that if your
.players file is very large, this becomes inefficient.  I will probably
make it disk-based in future versions.

The editor will adjust to different terminal heights (i.e. number of
rows), but it assumes that your terminal is at least 80 columns wide.

pped is written entirely in ANSI C.  So, you will need to supply whatever
flags are needed to put your compiler in ANSI mode.  Or, you can use gcc.

Do NOT change the .players file that is being used by the server if
there are people logged in to the server.
