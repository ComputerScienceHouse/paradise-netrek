	------ Netrek II: Paradise - Server ChangeLog ------

2007-08-27	Jeffrey Watts <watts@jayhawks.net>

	* 3.1p0 release.

	* Moved ChangeLog to docs/CHANGELOG.  Merged in the CHANGES file.

	* Moved docs/Notes to docs/TODO.

	* Added Erik Udo's patch to correct compilation issues.

	* conf.sysdef has been reformatted for ease of modification.  Some
	new rules are in effect.  By default all ship types are enabled.
	GalaxyGen-9 is the default now.  Minimum rank for shiptypes is
	set to zero (with comments indicating the correct rank) in order
	to make new servers a bit easier to get going.

	* Minor tweaks to etc/motd.

2000-04-26	Jeffrey Watts <watts@jayhawks.net>

	* Cleaned up the snake code.  Snakes now come in as IND by default
	(before it was random).  The usage statement has been enhanced
	and now gets issued on any command errors.  I also added 'snake'
	to the set of available god commands.

	Files: snake/snake.c, snake/snakemove.c, ntserv/message.c,
	include/defs.h

	* Added the first pass of the new "newbie" robot, RobotServ.  This
	robot is the modified base practice robot ("Smack") from Bronco.
	Thanks to Jeffrey Nowakowski for the mods that allow it to be
	used for our purposes.

	Files: robot/robot_newbie.c, robot/robot_newbie.h

	* Minor fix to 'wm' to make the '-k' option behave like the usage
	statement says it should behave.  Removed pointless "-h" line in
	the usage statement.

	Files: tools/tool-wm.c

2000-04-18	Jeffrey Watts <watts@jayhawks.net>

	* Tweaked galaxygen-9.c to diminish variance in the placement of
	race and independent systems.  Added this ChangeLog.

############################# Prior CHANGES ############################

2.4 patch 1b: (Brandon Gillespie / Rob Forsman)

   * Observer bug fix
   * even better setup script.  Note: it is now in the NETREKDIR, not
     NETREKDIR/src (so you can remove NETREKDIR/src/setup).
   * Galaxy Generator #6.  This isn't really more than Heath's Galaxy
     Generator #3 with a few tweaks on the settings, but I made it
     another generator rather than a define in config.h so you can use
     both generators.
   * Made the robot actually say something in binary (before he didn't)
   * Fixed the rank exemption for GODLIKE people (top to ranks of royalty)
     on ships.  Before it was backwards (i.e. Wesleys were exempt).
   * Exempted GODLIKE people from cluechecker #2
   * Added the RSA exemption file (Rob's)
   * fixed the WE ARE CLOSED message (wasn't displaying because line was
     too long).

2.4 patch 2: (Brandon Gillespie)

   * Adjusted default values per PLC decision
   * fixed some problems in the setup script
   * fixed a minor bug with announcing the end of a game.

2.4 patch 3: (Bob Glamm)

   * Despite this patch having my name on it, I contributed no actual
       code to this patch.  Rather, it is a compilation of bug fixes
       that people such as Sujal, Rob, and Joe contributed to the 
       mailing list but were too small to be considered 2.4p3
       individually.  Maybe they should have been 2.4p2.1, 2.2, etc??

2.4 patch 4: (Mike McGrath)

   * Added support for terrain features.
   * Implemented asteroids using the new terrain stuff.

2.4 patch 5: (Bob Glamm)

   * I actually did the coding for this one.
   * Socket code for Mike's terrains (nebula/asteroids)

2.4 patch 6: (Mike McGrath)
 
   * Asteroids are completely finished -- fields have different
     densities, thicknesses, distances from their parent star, etc.
   * Asteroids affect ships, in addition to weapons.
   * New PLC ship values turned default.

2.4 patch 7: (Bob Glamm)

   * Added FEATURE_PACKETS so the server wouldn't hose the client if the
     client couldn't understand terrain.  Note that these are probably not the
     same thing as Bronco feature packets.  Define as FEATURE in config.h
     (on by default).

2.4 patch 8: (Gary Parnes, Ken Germann)

   * Added higher wtemp for butt torpers (Gary Parnes)
   * Added ship-variable det distances (Ken Germann)

2.4 patch 9: (Mike McGrath)

   * Added basic nebula code
   * New orbital code, so planets don't end up same dist from stars, and so
     orbiting planets don't overlap.
   * New detdist (1750) made default,
     Variable det dist stuff used for CVs, and UTs, to make them tougher.
   * New low-fuel based explosion values made default.
   * Self-hurting torps made optional.
