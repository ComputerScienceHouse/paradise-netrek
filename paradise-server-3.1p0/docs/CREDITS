Many people have had influences on the game.  Before ParadiseII the major
developer was Larry Denys with help from Kurt Olsen and Brandon as his toadie.
When Paradise II was released Rob came onto the scene, then Mike McGrath and
Heath Kehoe.  Others have made many small contributions, but I cannot remember
them currently.  If stats can be found forward them to me (brandon@cc.usu.edu).

ParadiseII:
    Larry Denys, Kurt Olsen, Brandon Gillespie, and Rob Forsman
With help from:
