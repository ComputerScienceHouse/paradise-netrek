 ----- GAME NOTES -----

The current default configuration of this game does not bear much
resemblance to the older Paradise defaults.  The major features of
this configuration are:

  o  Top warp speed has been significantly decreased.  Fuel consumption
     has been increased.  There is no repairing during warp.
     As a result, it is no longer possible for a ship to simply
     zip around the galactic continuously evading attackers, and FUEL
     facilities have increased greatly in importance (see below as well).

  o  Planets no longer revolt if they have developed facilities.

  o  A new ship, the Transport, has been added.  This is a fuel tanker
     that can resupply fuel to two ships at once and is capable of
     holding 100,000 fuel on its own.

  o  It is no longer necessary to take over all the enemy's planets.
     In the current configuration reducing the number of enemy planets
     down to two will result in a victory.

  o  No kills are required to carry armies.  However, only an assault ship
     and starbases can carry armies.  The assault ship's torp and phaser
     ranges and damages have been drastically reduced, and its shields
     are practically non-existent (i.e., a TEAM effort is now required
     to take planets).

  o  To add to the fun, it is possible to lose armies into space if your
     shields are down and you are taking beyond 50% damage.

  o  Only certain ships can bomb certain things; the rest cannot bomb
     anything:
       - SC: can only bomb armies
       - BB: can bomb armies or facilities
       - AS: can bomb armies or facilities
       - WB: can bomb armies or facilities (gets double credit for bombing)

Paradise III is now a SourceForge project.  Go to

   http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=1104

for the latest information on client and server development and to
provide feedback (especially bug reports - see the Bug Tracking section
on that page) to the developers.

This code is the result of a massive cleanup of the last released
version of the server (which was 3.0).  The source code is approaching
readability.
